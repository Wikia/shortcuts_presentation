This repository contains tips and shortcuts in Intellij for JUG (JAVA USER GROUP) presentation.

All shortcuts are for windows version of Intellij

Many of them are same for linux but linux system override Intellij  
shortcuts so you need to either change system or intellij key map to make them work.

for mac and linux please see [jetbrains help page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/keyboard-shortcuts-you-cannot-miss.html)
